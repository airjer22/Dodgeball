3 Pin Dodgeball

I have created this Next.js application to assist myself in running a tournament for my students.  I used Bolt.New to help me create it as I am not a developer and do not know much about coding and decided to try to use AI to create a practical application that i could use to assist me in running the tournament.

Unfortunately, everytime I go to try to deploy this, I get errors which i don't understand and AI isn't helping in figure out why Netlify will not deploy the app.  If anyone with Next.js code experience wanted to take a look at the code and help me understand where the errors might lie, it would be greatly appreciated!
